/* Reads an unsigned integer of up to 24 bits taken from the bitstream.
 24 bits should suffice because longer values in H264 stream are encoded
 as Exp-Golomb codes, with zero-bit string indicating length of code (and
 number of less significant bits to follow. Now, we know that H264 start
 code is 23 zero bits followed by one (0x000001), and start-code emulation
 is carefully avoided in the stream. So Exp-Golob codes are probably limited
 to 22-long, and so reading 24 bits is enough.

 Previous version of code here used 64-bit values for extra safety which is
 unfortunately performance problem on 32-bit ARM CPU we have on the i.mx6 */

 * current location in the bitstream up to and including the first non-zero bit, and counting the
 * number of leading bits that are equal to 0. This process shall be equivalent to the following:

 * leadingZeroBits = -1;

 *      b = read_bits( 1 )

 * The variable codeNum is then assigned as follows:
 *      codeNum = 2^leadingZeroBits â€“ 1 + read_bits( leadingZeroBits )
 *
 * where the value returned from read_bits( leadingZeroBits ) is interpreted as a binary
 * representation of an unsigned integer with most significant bit written first.
